# Biography

I am currently a PhD student at the Victoria University of Wellington. My PhD is rooted in my Masterâ€™s project that examined the effect of ritualistic behaviour on stress recovery.

From there I became interested in other rituals, such as mindfulness. I am interested in establishing the effects and determinants of mindfulness and how it is situated in the wider context of ritual literature. If you are interested in my past and current projects have a look on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/jw7qh/).

Besides my PhD work I am actively working on method development for cross-cultural comparisons (You can follow my journey to develop a R package for cross-cultural psychology on Github). I am also interested in novel approaches to collecting environmental and physiological data using open source hardware.
