# Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and have previously worked as Lecturer in Cultural Psychology at the Victoria University of Wellington and Assistant Professor of Psychology at the Dublin City University. My current work broadly focuses on the origin and expression of individual differences in personality, values, and mindfulness. I have published on cross-cultural approaches to mindfulness, cross-temporal investigations of personality in literature using text mining, and network-perspectives on individual differences. Ongoing research projects include quantitative approaches to philosophy as way of live, the use of network statistics in cross-cultural psychology, and the origins and effects of non-ordinary experiences.
