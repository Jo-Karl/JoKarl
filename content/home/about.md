# Biography

I am a PhD student at the Victoria University of Wellington. My current work broadly focuses on the origin and expression of individual differences in personality, values, and mindfulness. I have published on cross-cultural approaches to mindfulness, cross-temporal investigations of personality in literature using text mining, and network-perspectives on individual differences. Ongoing research projects include quantitative approaches to philosophy as way of live, the use of network statistics in cross-cultural psychology, and state-trait interactions of mindfulness.
