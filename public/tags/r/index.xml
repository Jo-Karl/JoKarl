      <description>This is a very short post in which I want to highlight, because I realized that the issue is often overlooked by students when writing up their data. Today I want to highlight the difference between within- and between-subjects errors (With code examples).
Imagine you have data like this example below. Participants responded to a number of mindfulness items multiple times during the day over the duration of a week.</description>

      <description>MDS basicsThis post focuses on MDS (Also sometimes called smallest space analysis (Guttman, 1968) or multidimensional similarity structure analysis (Borg &amp;amp; Lingoes, 1987)) as exploratory tool and a large amount of the information is lifted from Borg and Gronen (2005) which I really recommend for further readings.
Exploratory MDS might seem at first glance like tea-leaf reading, but over the years several rules have been developed that aid in determining structure from the MDS plots.</description>
